# CRYPTO_TWEET_BERT_pre_train
 This notebook provides the required steps to train a BERT model for Crypto related tweets.
 
 A sample `.csv` file including 500000 Crypto tweets, which has been used for this pre_training, is uploaded in the repo. The purpose of this notebook is to pre_train a BERT model in the context of crypto tweets, which would improve the performance of later fine_tuning for tweets sentiment classification tasks.
